# Simple Process Hacker String Finder (V2)

This simple string finder was made in July 2020.

It allows you to find strings released by a program in a third-party process using [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io).

## How to use**

*   Clones this repository into a folder.
*   Choose the process in which you want to search for strings.
*   Open processhacker and save the memory strings of the process   
    before and after you started the program, save them in the legit and unlegit folders respectively.  
    (more files means better results, but it will naturally take more time)
*   Once you have all your files ready in the respective folders, you can launch the program

```console
python3 run.py
```

*   Now you’ll just have to wait...
